### PractiTest

Manage tests, test sets, and requirements in PractiTest. The agent connects directly to your project data, making it useful for QA workflows that need to bridge AI-generated content with your test management system.

The agent can help with:

- **Tests** — create, read, and update test cases
- **Test sets & runs** — manage test sets and track execution results
- **Requirements** — read requirements and analyze test coverage
- **Coverage analysis** — identify gaps between requirements and existing tests, then create missing tests and link them back to requirements
